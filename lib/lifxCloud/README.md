# Lifx Cloud

This driver requires a LIFX API token to run. You can get one from https://cloud.lifx.com/settings. You can then run this example by setting the LIFX_BEARER_TOKEN environment variable to that token:

```
LIFX_BEARER_TOKEN=myTokenValueHere npm start
```

Environement variables are useful to allow different settings without hardcoding the values in your driver.
